"""Declarative manifest data types for channel registration.

Plan 2026-05-25-002 Unit 1 — extends ``registry.register()`` with four
declarative metadata kwargs (``ui=``, ``bind=``, ``policy=``,
``visibility=``). The dataclasses defined here are the value types those
kwargs accept.

Design rules (per plan Key Decisions):

- ``frozen=True, slots=True`` — immutable, hashable, no per-instance
  ``__dict__`` overhead; safe to cache and share across requests.
- Declarative only. No methods, no callbacks. Behavioural logic stays
  in adapter / bind backend / WebUI layers.
- Optional everywhere. All current ``register()`` callers pass nothing
  here; new callers opt in field-by-field.
- ``extras: dict[str, Any]`` escape hatch on ``BindDescriptor`` for
  channel-specific fields that don't justify their own column yet
  (per Plan Unit 3 Velog pilot — recipe/selectors module paths).

This module is import-time leaf: it depends only on ``typing`` and
``dataclasses``. ``registry.py`` imports it; nothing in here imports
back. Keeps the legacy import-cycle gymnastics in ``registry.py``
unaffected.

# Visibility lifecycle states (Plan R7/R8/R9). The four-state enum
# subsumes three orthogonal needs: PR #136's ``HIDDEN_FROM_UI`` set
# (``hidden``), PR #197's "bind-passed filter" (``active`` is the only
# state that appears in publish UI by default), and unverified-dofollow
# rollout (``experimental`` — opt-in only via ``--include-experimental``
# or WebUI advanced mode).
#
# Semantics:
#   active       — default. Listed everywhere, available for publish.
#   experimental — gated behind opt-in flag; bind/publish allowed.
#   hidden       — UI hides it but existing bound configs still work
#                  (PR #136 write.as pattern).
#   retired      — config sections no longer round-tripped by
#                  ``save_config``; publish on existing bound config is
#                  *grace mode* (allowed with WARN log) per Unit 4
#                  deferred decision. Hard cutover left for a future
#                  PR after operator deprecation notice.
