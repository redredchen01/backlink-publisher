"""Adapter dispatcher — table-driven registry (Plan Unit 7).

Replaced the if/elif chain in the previous ``publish()`` with a
single ``dispatch()`` call into ``publishing.registry``. The Medium
fallback chain (MediumAPI → MediumBrave on macOS → MediumBrowser
on Playwright) is now expressed as registration order, and the
macOS gate lives on ``MediumBraveAdapter.available()``.

Behaviour preserved verbatim:

  - Blogger: ``BloggerAPIAdapter`` only.
  - Medium:
      1. ``MediumAPIAdapter`` (Integration Token; deprecated by Medium 2023)
      2. ``MediumBraveAdapter`` (AppleScript + Brave; macOS only;
         ``available()`` short-circuits elsewhere)
      3. ``MediumBrowserAdapter`` (Playwright headed Chrome — terminal)
  - ``DependencyError`` from one adapter → try the next.
  - ``ExternalServiceError`` (401 / 429 / network) → propagate, no fall.
  - ``dry_run=True`` → sentinel ``AdapterResult`` without publishing.
  - Unknown platform → ``ExternalServiceError("unsupported platform: …")``.
